## About

This repository is a collection of all the educational projects that were developed by attendees of our Summer Camp for Computer Science (Poletni tabor računalništva). For more than a decade, a team of seasoned coder monkeys has been evangelizing beauties of programming to youngsters from the whole country.

## What about previous years?

Don't worry! All your projects are still here! We use branches to snapshot all the work before we replace the content of our `main` branch.
